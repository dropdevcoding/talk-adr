<h2>Refinement (Controller)</h2>

<ul>
    <li class="fragment">
        What about the single responsibilty principle?
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">
        The controller is responsible for more than one action
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">
        What about dependency injection?
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">
        If indexAction needs other dependencies than removeAction all dependencies need to be injected though
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">
        Each method needs to know which response to sent (rendering a template etc.)
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">
        To avoid these disadvantages let's split the controller into separate action classes for each <b>ACTION</b>
        and get rid of the response since this should not be a job of an action
    </li>
</ul>
